"Legend / Footnotes:"
"<strong>n.s.</strong>  Not shown.  Data may not be shown for several reasons:"
"1. The data appear on another line in this table."
"2. The data are not shown in this table but may be available in detailed country- or industry-level tables in this interactive system or in other BEA published tables on direct investment."
"3. The data are not available, do not apply, or are not defined."
"<strong>(*)</strong> indicates a non-zero value between -$500,000 and +$500,000, or fewer than 50 employees, as appropriate."
"<strong>(D)</strong> indicates that the data in the cell have been suppressed to avoid disclosure of data of individual companies."
"Prior to 2006, income is presented net of U.S. and foreign withholding taxes. Beginning with 2006, income is presented gross of U.S. and foreign withholding taxes."
"The European Union (EU) includes an increasing number of member countries over time, and estimates for a specific period reflect the EU membership during that period. From 1982-1985, the member countries were collectively referred to as the European Communities and it included Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany (excluding the German Democratic Republic), Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. From 1986, it also includes Portugal and Spain. In 1992, the name European Union replaces European Communities. From 1995, it also includes Austria, Finland, and Sweden. From 2004, it also includes Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. From 2007, it also includes Bulgaria and Romania. From 2013, it also includes Croatia."
"OPEC is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Its members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. Prior to 1995, it included Gabon and prior to 1993, it included Ecuador. From 2007, it includes Angola.  In 2008, Ecuador reactivated its membership."
"Balance of payments transactions (and associated positions) between parents and affiliates are recorded against the country of the foreign affiliate with which the U.S. parent had a direct transaction, even if the transaction may reflect indirect claims on, liabilities to, or income from indirectly held affiliates in third countries.  For years prior to 1999, the ""<em>International</em>"" category consists of affiliates that have operations spanning more than one country and that are engaged in petroleum shipping, other water transportation, or offshore oil and gas drilling.  Beginning with the data for 1999, data for such affiliates are classified in the country of residence of the operator of the ship or equipment."
"The composition of the ""Other"" categories shown in this table may change from one year to another.  For a geographic area, ""Other"" is a residual that shows a total for all countries not shown separately under that area.  Because the countries shown separately may change over time as the composition of direct investment changes, data for a particular country may be included in an ""Other"" total in one year but excluded from it in another year.  Changes in the countries shown separately generally take place in years covered by benchmark surveys (or censuses) of direct investment, which usually are conducted once every five years."

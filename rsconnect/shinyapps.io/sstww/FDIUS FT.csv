"<strong>n.s.</strong>  Not shown.  Data may not be shown for several reasons:"
"1. The data appear on another line in this table."
"2. The data are not shown in this table but may be available in detailed country- or industry-level tables in this interactive system or in other BEA published tables on direct investment."
"3. The data are not available, do not apply, or are not defined."
"<strong>(*)</strong> indicates a non-zero value between -$500,000 and +$500,000, or fewer than 50 employees, as appropriate."
"<strong>(D)</strong> indicates that the data in the cell have been suppressed to avoid disclosure of data of individual companies."
"Prior to 2006, income is presented net of U.S. and foreign withholding taxes. Beginning with 2006, income is presented gross of U.S. and foreign withholding taxes."
"The European Union (EU) includes an increasing number of member countries over time, and estimates for a specific period reflect the EU membership during that period. From 1982-1985, the member countries were collectively referred to as the European Communities and it included Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany (excluding the German Democratic Republic), Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. From 1986, it also includes Portugal and Spain. In 1992, the name European Union replaces European Communities. From 1995, it also includes Austria, Finland, and Sweden. From 2004, it also includes Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. From 2007, it also includes Bulgaria and Romania. From 2013, it also includes Croatia."
"OPEC is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Its members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. Prior to 1995, it included Gabon and prior to 1993, it included Ecuador. From 2007, it includes Angola.  In 2008, Ecuador reactivated its membership."
"Data are classified by country of the <em>foreign parent</em> of the U.S. affiliate.  The foreign parent is the first person outside the United States in a U.S. affiliate's ownership chain that has a direct investment in the affiliate.  In addition to equity and debt investment from its foreign parent, a U.S. affiliate may receive loans from (or make loans to) foreign affiliates of the foreign parent (FAFPs).  The affiliate may also have interest and services transactions with foreign affiliates of the foreign parent.  The value of these loans and the interest and services transactions are included in these data and are classified by country of the FAFP."
"The composition of the ""Other"" categories shown in this table may change from one year to another.  For a geographic area, ""Other"" is a residual that shows a total for all countries not shown separately under that area.  Because the countries shown separately may change over time as the composition of direct investment changes, data for a particular country may be included in an ""Other"" total in one year but excluded from it in another year.  Changes in the countries shown separately generally take place in years covered by benchmark surveys (or censuses) of direct investment, which usually are conducted once every five years."
